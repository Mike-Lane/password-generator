I have been tasked with creating a password generator that fulfills the following requirements:

<ul>
    <li>Generator creates a new, secure password.</li>
    <li>Password should be between 8 and 128 characters.</li>
    <li>User should be asked if they want to use lowercase and/or uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters, of which at least one option <strong>MUST</strong> be selected. </li>
    <li>Password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.</li>
</ul>
